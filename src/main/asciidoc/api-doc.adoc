= Getting Started With WEAS diff app

== The solution is Spring boot based and considers the following things
== 1. String is the only allowed object to be Base 64 encoded
== 2. Embedded Mongo DB has been considered for document store.
== 3. Document has been structured around JSON
== 4. REST endpoints are strictly JSON content processing
== 5. Input validation is Javax validation driven with custom validator.
== 6. Proper DB isolation has been considered using Java8 concurrent locks.
== 7. Exception handler has been put to place.
== 8. Custom REST error has been created to handle system exceptions and HTTP errors
== 9. Focus has been given more in integration testing.
== 10. Documentation has been created using Spring RESTDocs and JUnit.
== 11. Code itself is the documentation here.
== 12. ASCIIDoctor style code API doc generation has been done.

== Things out of scope
== 1. DB scaling or sharding
== 2. Secure REST services
== 3. HTTPS
== 4. Auto-scaling
== 5. Generic binary object handling, would not be possible for doing diff.

`== One open question : when files are of same length but have differences in them, what is meant by "length in data" ?`

Examples of important test scenarios covered to meet the objectives of the solution
